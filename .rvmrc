# Setup
#
# If you want to use this with you local rvm you can create a local rvmrc
# like this:
#
#    echo "source .rvmrc" >> .rvmrc
#
# That file can be used set other enviroment varables (quite useful for
# database configuration) or any other configuration.
#
# Unless it is setup as a global gem in rvm, you may need to install the
# bundler gem at this point:
#
#    gem install bundler
#
#
# Getting Fancy
#
# If you wanted to get fancy, you could do something like this in your
# .rvmrc file:
#
#     [ -f .rvmrc.default ] && source .rvmrc.default || echo "Warning: No .rvmrc.default found"
#
